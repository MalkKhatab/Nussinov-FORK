# Nussinov-Algorithm
Nussinov Algorithm for RNA Secondary Structure Prediction

Idea (biological): 
Stacked base pairs of helical regions are considered to stabilize an RNA molecule.
So the goal is to maximize the number of base pairs.

IN: 
RNA sequence S
OUT: 
a non-crossing RNA structure P of S that maximizes
